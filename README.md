\# Cloud Data Ingestion and Warehouse on AWS



This project implements a production-style end-to-end data engineering pipeline on AWS.



The pipeline ingests data from external REST APIs, performs validation and transformation,

and loads analytics-ready datasets into Amazon Redshift.



The project follows enterprise best practices including modular design, secure credential

management, data quality checks, and workflow orchestration.



Documentation, architecture diagrams, and execution steps will be added incrementally.
